The technologies I used for completing this task were: Visual Studio Code(Laravel and Blade) 
and Xampp(phpmyadmin). I managed to create a simple application for users who want to manage their tasks.
Users can create, read, update and delete their tasks based on their preferences. In order to run the 
application run migrations. The landing page is a login page where you login or you go to register page to
register as a user. After registering or loging in we go to dashboard page where the user can see his own 
tasks, create a task, edit a task or delete a task. When creating a task a user has to add a title,
description, status and priority while the time of creation is added automatically. When editing a task the
time of this update will be registered in the database. When creating or editing a task the title and 
description of the task are required and the user will be notified with corresponding alerts. In the 
dashboard page the user can also delete a task by pressing the delete button and confirming the action 
in the confirmation box. The user can view a task in dashboard by pressing in the view button. The user 
can filter based on the status and priority of the task by choosing the options he wants and than pressing 
the search button.
